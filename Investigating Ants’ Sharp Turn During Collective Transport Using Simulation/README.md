# Investigating Antsâ€™ Sharp Turn During Collective Transport Using Simulation
Final project for ***CSCI 5423 (Bio-inspired Multi-Agent System)*** in Spring 2023 semester.

Created by ***Sitong Lu*** ([visualization tool](https://github.com/akitomoya616/CSCI-5423-Project/tree/main/Project)) & ***Jooseok Lee*** ([data simulation](https://github.com/akitomoya616/CSCI-5423-Project/blob/main/Rule%20formulation.ipynb)).

**Algorithm** for making the next movement decision for a single ant (before applying it into this visualization tool) was demonstrated and simulated [here](https://github.com/akitomoya616/CSCI-5423-Project/blob/main/Rule%20formulation.ipynb).

**Project proposal** can be found [here](https://github.com/akitomoya616/CSCI-5423-Project/blob/main/Proposal.pdf).

# Installation Instrcution
1. Install Qt by following this instruction [here](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/resources/qt/install-windows).
2. Once the project is pulled, delete `Project.pro.user` file and run `Project.pro` file under [Project directory](https://github.com/akitomoya616/CSCI-5423-Project/tree/main/Project) to start the simulation.

# Demonstration & Report
